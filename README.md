# Hugh
Alternative Hue app with **marvellous** cortana implementation

## Application Functionality

This app shows the basic implementation of Cortana in a Philips hue light context.

The structure of the app accomodates a structure for using Cortana to launch the app and take action depending on the spoken command.

The background task abilities of Cortana for executing code without the need for launching the app, sadly didn't work.

## To start the app

Please open the solution and start running. After the app has been installed Cortana should have registered the voice commands.

Ask Cortana "What can I say?" and at the bottom the of the list "Hugh" should be listed with examples.

Please set your Windows 10 computer language to English (UK) within the Region & Language settings under Time & Language

## What have we learned

We learned several things, really.

We got an insight into the current state of Microsoft by using their proud new technology and reaching its limitations rather quickly. We learned that there's a long road ahead for our buddies at Microsoft.

We learned the basic ideas behind using Speech Recognition services to assist in the app's flow.

We learned about the structure of MVVM model applications and arranged this app as such.

We learned the use of Background Tasks

We learned about porting existing structures from the old Windows 8.1 platform to the current UWP.

That should be enough.
